# Genesis Sample Theme Changelog

## [2.8.0] - 2019-01-16
Requires Genesis 2.8.0+.

* New: Block-based homepage layout.
* New: Auto homepage setup upon theme activation using the new onboarding feature from Genesis 2.8.0. (See `config/onboarding.php`.)
* New: “Blocks” page template for use with the block editor. The template removes the title and breadcrumbs, and forces a full-width layout.
* New: Load configuration with the new `genesis_get_config()` function from Genesis 2.8.0. (See `functions.php` and the `config/` folder.)
* New: Add `has-no-blocks` body class if singular post/page contains no blocks.
* New: Add `first-block-[block-name]` body class. Helps remove top padding when blocks such as the Cover block are first on the page.
* New: Add `first-block-align-[alignment]` body class. Helps adjust styles if the first block is full-width.
* Update: Styling adjustments for buttons, content width, and column blocks.
* Update: Prevent 'admin' user being created during manual XML demo content import.
* Update: Remove editor font sizes shortname from Gutenberg font sizes config. (The shortname is no longer used in WordPress.)
